            Dr. Snehalata Huzurbazar has been working at the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing since early 2024 with a 
            secondary position as Director of the provisional AI track in the Nursing PhD program. 
            Most recently, she was Professor of Data Science and Associate Director in the School of Mathematical and Data Sciences at 
            West Virginia University (WVU), where she founded the Data Science program in 2020. She was Chair of Biostatistics at WVU (2017-2019), 
            Professor of Statistics at the University of Wyoming (1995-2017), and Deputy Director (2012-14) of the NSFâ€™s Statistical and 
            Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute in North Carolina. Earlier in her career, she was a Visiting Scientist at the 
            Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, Boulder and she also initiated and obtained NIJ funding to start the 
            STOP Violence program at the Univ of Wyoming. She is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and an Elected Member of the 
            International Statistical Institute. Her methodological and interdisciplinary research is now at the intersection of statistics and 
            data science, with a view towards uncertainty quantification. She earned her PhD in Statistics from Colorado State University, her MA in 
            Economics from Vanderbilt University and her BA from Grinnell College. 
            She is one of the two statistical editors for the journal Anesthesiology
